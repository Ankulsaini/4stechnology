                include ladies hand bags or laptop bags of gents. For this
                purpose generally tunnel size of 50x30cm is preferred. For
                larger sizes of carry bags machines having tunnel size of
                65x50 cm is preferred or for air ports where large size of
                suitcases are to be scanned tunnel size of 100x100cm
                is preferred The process of scanning is simple and quick.
                You can immediately view on the monitor Non-flickering
                digital image for which there is provision for archiving.
                There are many other features and software that can be provided on these machines to look after
